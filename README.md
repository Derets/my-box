# My Box

**MyBox** is a site, a 3D gift box constructor that **everyone** can use at this link: https://my-box-d3a18.web.app/

This is my first pet project written in **MERN** stack to show my skills and knowledge in web development.

The focus is **functionality**, not design.

## Features

- Interactive **3D models** of gift boxes with many custom settings
- Language mode toggle (EN/UA)
- **Sending emails** during the order, registration, password recovery, or email reconfirmation
- Saving your orders on the database
- **Admin system**
- **Auto-complete** personal information from the profile when ordering

## Used libraries and frameworks

**Client(8):** React.js, GSAP, React OAuth2 | Google, React Hook Form, React Router, React Three Drei, React Three Fiber, jwt-decode;

**Server(12):** Node.js, Express, Mongoose, JSON Web Token, Nodemon, Nodemailer, Mailgen, Bcrypt.js, Body-parser, Dotenv, Mongoose-unique-validator, Express Validator;

**Testing:** Postman;

**Deployment:** Client - Firebase, Server - Heroku.

## Description
**Google authentication** is implemented on this site, but you also have the opportunity to register through regular mail, but you will need to confirm it.
There is also an implementation of **administrators** who can see all registered users and all their orders.
The implementation of this project from scratch took **less than 5 weeks**.
